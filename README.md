**BerkeleyAdmissionQuizApp**
> A dumb introductory application to android that asks the user, which of the two number buttons present is greatest. 
It also keeps track of points gained and lost during the play session by dynamically updating a TextView.

**To Do List**
> A robust application that permits the user to save tasks within an ArrayList without there being any loss in data.
The ArrayList is then hooked to an ArrayAdapter which is set to a listView for the user to observe the data saved/added.
