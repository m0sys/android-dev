	<h3>Berkeley Admission Quiz App</h3>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
		A dumb introductory application to android development filled with the hate that Stanford has for Berkeley. Joke aside, the application asks the user which of the two number buttons present on the screen is greatest. The app keeps track of points gained and lost during the play session by dynamically updating the <strong>TextView</strong> class. 
		</p>
	</blockquote>
	
	<h3>To Do List</h3>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
		A robust applicaton that permits the user to save tasks within an <strong>ArrayList</strong> without there beining and data losses when the application gets terminated. The <strong>ArrayList</strong> is saved and is accesible for use during the next session. The <strong>ArrayList</strong> is hooked to an <strong>ArrayAdapter</strong> which is set to the <strong>listView</strong> for the user to observe the data that has been saved or added to the <strong>ArrayList</strong>.
