## About

Android development was one of my greatest experience so far in my programming career. Starting around mid November 2016, I found this amazing course online which was an android version of the best online course you could find for IOS development, namley <em>CS193</em>. My main focus during the time I took the course was to finish it within 2 months. That being my goal I was ready to put aside what others thought as being important, and focused on what I enjoyed. Android development with the help of Matry Stepp couldn't have been any more easier to learn.
